You sell services using TMDb's APIs to bring users' TMDb content into your service.
Your site is a "destination" site that uses TMDb content to drive traffic and generate revenue.
Your site generates revenue by charging users for access to content related to TMDb content such as movies, television shows and music.

Please note that in some cases we may grant your request for a commercial API key subject to your payment of fees, such as to help cover infrastructure costs.

Please note, however, that under Section 512(f) any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is a copyright infringement may be subject to liability for damages. You should educate yourself as to whether content does, in fact infringe upon your copyright, or whether, for instance "fair use" under 17 U.S.C. ยง107 applies. If you are unsure whether the content you are reporting is infringing your legal rights, you may wish to seek legal guidance. Keep in mind that submitting intentionally misleading reports of infringement may be punishable under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States or similar laws in other countries.
